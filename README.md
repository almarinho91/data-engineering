# Data Engineering

This repository contains small data engineering projects I build to practice and learn.

Each folder is a standalone project, focused on a specific data engineering problem or workflow.

  End-to-end pipeline that ingests public weather data, models it using a raw → staging → mart structure, runs basic data quality checks, and exports analytics-ready datasets.

More projects will be added over time.
