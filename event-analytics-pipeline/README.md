# Event Analytics Pipeline

This project is a small data engineering pipeline built to work with event-level data (application logs).

The goal is to practice ingestion, data modeling, data quality checks, and analytics-ready outputs using simulated event data.

Event data is generated locally to mimic real-world scenarios such as duplicates, late-arriving events, and incomplete records.

More features will be added incrementally.
